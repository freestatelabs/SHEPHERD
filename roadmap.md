# Development Roadmap

## Tier 1 
* Linear elastic static structural analysis 
* Modal analysis
* Elements (first and second order)
  * 1D beams and springs
  * 2D triangles and rectangles
  * 3D tet's, hex's, wedges 
* Loads: point/distributed forces, pressures, moments
* Boundary conditions: fixed/selected DOFs
* MKL Pardiso and AOCL-Sparse solver support
* Interoperability with Calculix input files

## Tier 2 
* Elastic-plastic material models
* Thermal analysis
* Thermal loads (temperature maps)
* Large deflection
* Bonded contact

## Tier 3 
* Sine vibration
* Random vibration
* Buckling
* Sliding contact
* GPU solver support

## Tier 4 
* Transient - modal superposition
* Nonlinear transient
